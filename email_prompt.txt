Persona: I am a customer outreach executive working for AWS. I want to reach out to potential customers with periodic emails. The emails should be customized based on past email history (opened vs unopened), Cost trends for the customer and support tickets. If support ticket is still unresolved that could be a good outreach content.

Customercity AWS Startup Migrate Program Credits 17-Apr Unopened John.Smith@amazon.com Jane Doe [Initiated by Boost] Hi Jane Doe, My name is John Smith and I'm part of your AWS Account Team. We have identified Customercity as a high priority candidate for Incremental Workloads Migrate Funding. This funding will support in lowering the cost associated with migrating external workloads into AWS. I've highlighted a few of the benefits of this program below: * Technical and financial analysis of these external workloads by your AWS Solutions Architect to ensure the migration is beneficial from an infrastructure optimization perspective * AWS Service Credits (up to 3x monthly revenue of migration) + additional Partner Funding to accelerate the migration while lowering your costs Example: If migrating an external workload to AWS and the Amazon Monthly Calculator [https://calculator.aws/#/]¬†estimates that workload to be $10K/month on AWS, you would be eligible for up to $30K in AWS credits to offset the costs associated with migrating. Are you available next week to discuss this program further and review potential workloads you would like to move onto AWS with your dedicated account team? If you are not the right person to reach out to regarding this program, please let me know who the correct contact is.

Customercity AWS Sagemaker Feedback 02-Apr Opened John.Smith@amazon.com Jane Doe Hi John, I wanted to share some feedback on our recent experience with AWS Sagemaker. Our data science team has been using Sagemaker for the past few months to build and deploy machine learning models, and the results have been impressive. Some key benefits we've seen: * Significant reduction in time to build and train models * Ability to easily scale our ML workloads * Seamless integration with other AWS services like S3 and Lambda One specific use case where Sagemaker really shined was in building a recommendation engine for our e-commerce platform. Using Sagemaker's built-in algorithms and frameworks, we were able to quickly develop a model that provided highly relevant product recommendations to our customers. This resulted in a 20% increase in average order value and a 15% boost in conversion rates. We're excited to continue exploring Sagemaker's capabilities and applying them to more use cases across our organization. If you have any best practices or additional resources to share, we'd love to learn more. Thanks for your ongoing support! Regards, Joshua Wright Data Science Manager Customercity
